# Humber Semester Calendar
A semester-at-a-glance calendar for Humber Polytechnic.

## How to Use

1. Provide caption text - the text you want to see at the top of your calendar.
2. Select the starting term/semester: January, May, or September.
3. Enter the day of the month of the *first Monday* - even if the Monday is a holiday (e.g. Labour Day).
4. Create your calendar.

### Note
The dates are coming from a spreadsheet hand-coded so there won't be dates beyond the current or imminent semester.
